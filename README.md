VM-Up

This is *totally* not a hacky Vagrant-clone that I wrote myself.  No siree-bob.

Nope, I told you, that's not what it is.  It's just a Python script/library for
bringing up libvirt KVM/QEmu VMs while sharing certain directories from the host
without having to specify the complete libvirt XML, and...

oh, I see what you mean.

Sorry.  I meant to write the section that says "Use at your own risk.  This may
format your hard drive or cause your CPU to catch on fire" closer to the top of
this README.

Well, now you know. Here's some cake to make up for it: :cake:
